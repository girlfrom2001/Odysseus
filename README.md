## Final Project requirements

You are to create a text adventure game in the spirit of Zork and other similar games. The following are requirements for the game:

- A minimum of 8 rooms
- Each room should be its own function.
- You can move freely between connected rooms (in other words, your game canâ€™t be a single one-way road)
- Your program should accept the commands _north_, _east_, _south_, and _west_ (or some equivalent to these four commands) as well as _look_.
- You should have at least one puzzle for the user to solve.
- You should have an inventory in the game. The inventory should be instrumental for solving at least one puzzle. Remember that you can check if something is in a list using the "in" keyword.
- Each room should have a description that is printed when you enter the room.
- Your program should be well-organized, well-documented, and easy to read.
